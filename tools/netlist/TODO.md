======

- Reporting of variables in the netlist (by type, matching patterns).
- Infer sequential elements in the netlist (ie non-blocking assignment and
  sensitive to a clock edge).
- Constrain paths to start on particular node types (port, register, net etc).
- Support restricting paths to stop at sequential elements.
- Support paths passing through particular nodes.
- Support paths avoiding particular nodes.
- Support reporting of paths fanning into or out of a particular node.
- Provide Python bindings.
