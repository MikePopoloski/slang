All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Language Support
* Select expressions of packed arrays now always return an unsigned type, as mandated by the LRM
* Clocking skew delays now properly require a constant value
* Enforce that static methods can't have override specifiers
* The error for invalid state-dependent path conditions in specify blocks can now be downgraded with -Wspecify-condition-expr for compatibility with other tools

* Added [-Wuseless-cast](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#useless-cast) to warn about explicit casts to the same type as the underlying expression
* Added [-Wunknown-sys-name](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#unknown-sys-name) to allow downgrading the error that occurs when referencing an unknown system task or function
* Added [compilation unit listings](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#unit-listing) to allow fine grained control over how sources are parsed into separate compilation units (including separating macro defines and include directories on a per-unit basis)
* Added `--defaultLibName` to control the name of the default source library
* Added `--std` to choose which version of the LRM slang should conform to. By default this is "1800-2017" but can be set to "1800-2023" to enable new features added in the recently published update to the SystemVerilog LRM.
* Added a new experimental tool, slang-hier, that prints elaborated instances in a design (thanks to @udif)

## [v5.0] - 2023-12-26
### Language Support
* Added support for specifying a modport when connecting an interface array port
* Implicitly typed parameters that have range specifications are now considered assignment-like contexts (this behavior is not specified in the LRM but more intuitively matches user expectations)
* Added support for using assignment patterns as lvalues (which finally finishes full support for assignment patterns)
* Added partial support for SystemVerilog configurations. Support is incomplete and may be buggy.
* Index selects after range/part selects are now disallowed, to conform to the LRM as well as match the behavior of other tools
* An error is now issued for interface ports that connect hierarchically through a generate or instance array, as mandated by the LRM
* An error is now issued for generic interface ports that are connected via a wildcard connection, as mandated by the LRM
* Rules about where classes with private members are allowed to be used in bitstream casts are now enforced
* Relaxed requirement that DPI import declarations have an explicit return type to match behavior of other tools
* Added `-Wdpi-pure-task` to allow downgrading the error that DPI import tasks cannot be marked `pure`
* Added `--relax-string-conversions` (included in "vcs" compat mode) to allow strings to implicitly convert to integers
* Added `--allow-recursive-implicit-call` to allow implicit call expressions to be recursive function calls for compatibility with other tools

### General Features
* Minimum required compiler versions have been bumped to GCC 11, clang 16, and Xcode 15 (should be the last bump for a while)
* Minimum required cmake version has been bumped to 3.20
* Added `--allow-toplevel-iface-ports` to allow top level modules that have interface ports
* Added [-Wconstant-conversion](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#constant-conversion) which warns about conversions inside constant expressions that lose information
* Added [-Wsign-conversion](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#sign-conversion) which warns about implicit integral conversions that change sign
* Added a `-L` option to control the default [source library](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#source-libraries) search order
* The `--diag-hierarchy` option now takes a parameter of "always", "never", or "auto" to allow forcing or hiding instance paths in diagnostics

### Improvements
* Made several improvements to -Wimplicit-conv to make it less noisy
* Cleaned up internal code related to wide character support for Windows. slang now relies on the relatively new utf-8 code page support in Windows; this does mean that Unicode paths will now only be handled correctly on or after Windows Version 1903 (May 2019 Update).
* The maximum size of a type has been increased to 2^31 bytes (which matches VCS)
* The `--suppress-warnings` feature has been optimized to not perform unnecessary filesystem operations

### Fixes
* Fixed a case where -Wimplicit-conv would not be issued for mismatching struct types
* Fixed a crash when $static_assert condition is parenthesized
* Fixed the count of compilation errors reported when using -Werror along with `--suppress-warnings`
* Fixed -Wvector-overflow to work correctly with signed literals
* Fixed the type infered for parameters that are assigned vector literals larger than 32-bits wide
* SystemVerilog class types (and other types that contain them) are now limited to the max object size supported by slang (the same limit for structs and arrays that was already present)
* Fixed a few places where large types or expressions could result in internal overflow of variables tracking their sizes, which could cause crashes or other strange behavior. Now a proper error is issued.
* A proper error is now issued for duplicate local variables inside of properties and sequences
* Fixed a crash when trying to connect an extern subroutine implementation to an interface array port
* Fixed a spurious error about signals being multi-driven from uninstantiated generate blocks
* Fixed a spurious error when streaming concatenations are used in port connections of uninstantiated modules
* An appropriate parse error is now issued for generate blocks that are missing a body
* Fixed a crash when classes with cycles in their members are used in a cast expression
* Fixed a bug in parsing parameter ports when their type was explicitly package scoped and the parameter keyword was elided
* Fixed a bug in the slang driver that prevented showing instance paths in diagnostics
* An error is now issued for invalid use of the unique and priority keywords in `else` blocks


## [v4.0] - 2023-08-10
### Language Support
* Finished full support for user-defined primitives by adding error checking for table entries
* Support for whitespace between the two characters of the dist weight operators has been added for compatibility with other tools -- this is an error by default but can be downgraded as needed. See [-Wsplit-distweight-op](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#split-distweight-op).
* Added support for net aliases
* Added support for checkers
* Added support for extern modules/interfaces/programs/primitives, along with wildcard port lists in declaration headers

### General Features
* slang now requires a C++20 compatible compiler to build (e.g. minimum GCC 10)
* New warnings [-Wport-width-expand](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#port-width-expand) and [-Wport-width-trunc](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#port-width-trunc) separate out width warnings that occur in port connections from general expressions elsewhere. This makes it easier to find and target these specific cases of width mismatches.
* New option `--suppress-macro-warnings` that functions similarly to `--suppress-warnings` except that it applies to the original definition location of macros instead of their expansion location. This is useful if, for example, you want to hide warnings from 3rd party macros (like from UVM) that you use in your own code.
* A new experimental tool called `slang-netlist` has been added (thanks to @jameshanlon) -- see the [readme](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/blob/master/tools/netlist/README.md) for more details
* A new experimental tool called `slang-reflect` has been added (thanks to @Sustrak) -- see the [readme](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/tree/master/tools/reflect/README.md) for more details
* The slang build optionally supports obtaining dependencies via [conan.io](https://conan.io/) -- see [the docs](https://sv-lang.com/building.html#dependencies) for details.
* The slang driver now accepts [file patterns](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#file-patterns) to make it easier to select groups of files
* Initial support for [source libraries](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#source-libraries) and library map files has been added. This is only for specifying input files right now but in future releases will be expanded to work with SystemVerilog config declarations.

### Improvements
* When dealing with duplicate module/interface/program definitions (where the error has been downgraded to a warning) slang will now make use of the first definition seen instead of any later ones, to better match the behavior of other tools
* Improved the warnings issued for unused 'inout' ports
* Macros declared in slang headers have been namespaced to avoid polluting user code
* Several hash table implementations used by slang (ska::flat_hash_map, unordered_dense, StringTable) have been removed and consolidated into using boost::unordered. The library includes a minimal boost_unordered.hpp header to avoid needing to depend on all of boost.
* Added a dependency on the mimalloc custom allocator (can be disabled if desired)
* A number of small optimizations (including the switch to boost::unordered and use of mimalloc) combine to improve general slang compilation performance by about 10%
* slang can now build correctly with exceptions and RTTI disabled, to allow integration with other codebases that disable use of these features
* The slang driver will now parse input files in multiple threads by default. This can be disabled with `--threads=1`. This feature is not supported when using `--single-unit`.
* The `--libdir` feature will now search for files based on interface port declarations in addition to module instantiations (thanks to @AndrewNolte)
* Support for visitors has been added to the Python bindings (thanks to @tdp2110)
* Low-level file loading routines in slang have been rewritten to use platform-level APIs. This should slightly improve performance, but more importantly it allows slang to report system-specific error messages when file loading fails.
* Failed file loads invoked via the Python bindings now raise an appropriate Python exception
* The `--suppress-warnings` option has been changed to take a file pattern instead of a directory path prefix. Existing uses of this flag will need to be updated to the new behavior.
* Most command line arguments that accept multiple values now accept those values as a comma-separated list in addition to repeating the argument multiple times
* slang can now read input from stdin by specifying a file named '-'

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug that prevented indexing into an interface array when accessing that array hierarchically
* break and continue statements are now correctly disallowed from controlling a loop outside of a fork-join block
* Duplicate driver checking now applies to signals accessed via modports
* Subroutine ports with initializers will now issue an appropriate error
* Subroutine argument default values are now checked for the correct direction and count as drivers for target symbols
* Fixed messaging generated by elaboration system tasks when arguments are invalid
* Fixed an off-by-one error in symbol lookup location for detecting whether parameters are used before they are declared
* Fixed a few return value policies in the Python bindings that were incorrect
* Fixed a bug where a continuous assign statement that referenced an implicit net more than once would cause an error about duplicate net declarations
* Fixed the use of the $global_clocking system functions in direct event controls
* Fixed an erroneous diagnostic when checking which kinds of expressions are allowed in a binary `and` or `or` property expression
* Fixed parsing of tagged patterns when followed immediately by a `&&&` predicate
* Added tests and fixed resulting issues found in AST serialization and visitation methods
* The Compilation constructor now ensures it safely only adds type diagnostic printing callbacks once, to allow multithreaded use of separate Compilation objects
* Fixed the error message reported for -Wimplicit-port-type-mismatch -- it was reporting the wrong types involved
* Fixed parsing of parameter ports that have multiple declarators -- previously later parameters in the list were not being associated with the prior type declaration


## [v3.0] - 2023-03-18
### Highlights
As of this release slang passes 100% of the tests at https://github.com/chipsalliance/sv-tests (the only tool able to do so).

### Language Support
* Added support for specify module timing paths
* Added support for specify pulsestyle and showcancelled directives
* Added support for `PATHPULSE$` specparams
* Added support for system timing checks
* Added support for program namespacing rules
* Added support for anonymous programs
* Added support for DPI open array typed arguments
* Added support for `$inferred_clock` and `$inferred_disable`
* Finished full support for bind directives
* Finished full support for defparams

### General Features
* New option `--obfuscate-ids` when used with `--preprocess` will replace all identifiers in the output with obfuscated alphanumeric strings (thanks to @Sustrak)
* Added a group of new warnings to report on unused code elements; see [-Wunused](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#unused)
* A new (currently experimental) tool, `slang-tidy`, has been added as a place to collect more in-depth or project-specific static analysis rules (thanks to @Sustrak).
* New option `--suppress-warnings` allows suppressing warnings from one or more file paths, intended to allow easily hiding warnings from 3rd party code

### Improvements
* The default library name for slang has been changed to "libsvlang" to avoid clashing with an existing "S-lang" package on most Linux systems. The library name is now configureable via CMake.
* Errors about unknown package names are now ignored in lint-only mode
* Drastically improved the performance of overlapping driver checking and driver loop unrolling. For large projects this may reduce compile times by as much as 80-90%.
* Net charge strength and drive strength have been added to the AST
* Added human-friendly names for function arguments in Python bindings (thanks to @Kuree)
* Conditional statements in constant functions now implement unique/priority semantics (thanks to @HungMingWu)
* Procedural force/release of bit selects or part selects is an error according to the LRM; this error can now be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools (thanks to @udif)
* Implicit named port connections with inequivalent types are disallowed by the LRM; this error can now be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools
* When printing type names in diagnostics, if more than one type shares the same simple name, they will now be disambiguated with their full path
* A new `--timescale` option allows setting a default time scale for design elements. If this option is not set, there is no default and an error will be
issued if not all elements have a time scale specified (as required by the LRM).

### Fixes
* Parameters used inside specify blocks will now issue an appropriate warning
* Fixed an issue where the parser erroneously allowed selects of integer literal expressions
* Top-level programs are now automatically instantiated, just like top-level modules
* Implicit covergroups declared inside classes were previously not being checked for correctness
* Fixed parser handling of spacing within `always@( *)` statements being misinterpreted as a closing attribute token (thanks to @godblesszhouzhou)
* Fixed a bug in the lookup location used for non-ansi port symbol attribute expressions
* Fixed `-Werror` to actually work
* Tweaked handling of unbased unsized literals to reduce false-positive width warnings
* Changed scoped access to incomplete forward typedefs to be allowed as long as the final name in the chain is not a type (matches behavior of other tools)
* The parser now correctly disallows attributes on assignment operators
* References to compilation unit items from within packages is now correctly disallowed
* Hierarchical references from packages to items outside that package are now correctly disallowed
* Bit-vector system functions (such as `$countbits`) can now be used with bitstream types (as opposed to just integral types)
* Max size limits for packed and unpacked arrays and structs are now strictly enforced
* Invalid inferred time scales will now issue an appropriate error
* Fixed a bug in arithmetic of large constants at compile time (thanks to @adream307)


## [v2.0] - 2022-10-29
### Highlights
This release focuses on making slang much more usable as a library. There's been a large amount of refactoring
and reorganizing to make usage more straightforward. The CMake build was rewritten, and documentation showing how to
integrate the library has been improved. Python bindings have been added to make it easy to use slang in scripts and tools.

### Language Support
* Added support for modport port expressions
* Added support for modport exports and `extern` interface methods (including the rules for `extern forkjoin` methods)
* Directionality of modport ports is now enforced (e.g. assigning to an input modport port is now an error)
* Added full support for SystemVerilog's pattern matching feature, including usage in constant expressions
* Added parsing support for config declarations
* The parser now enforces syntax rules around specify block edge descriptors
* Port connection slicing across arrays of instances is now also allowed with implicit port connections
* Access to static class data members via an incomplete forward typedef is now allowed
* Compile-time constant out-of-bounds element and range selects have always been an error in slang. The LRM allows for them to either be an error or optionally to result in `'x` and compilation to continue -- to support this option the resulting errors have been changed to suppressible warnings (though still set to errors by default).
* `` `pragma protect`` directives are now validated for correctness and encoded text is now decoded by slang (in all four decoding formats mentioned by the LRM). Actual encrypted text is not decrypted but just skipped instead -- it's very unlikely any IP vendor will ever provide slang with a decryption key so there's little point in implementing it.
* Duplicate module / interface / program / primitive definitions have been made a suppressible error to support legacy workflows (thanks to @udif)

### General Features
* New warning: [-Wempty-body](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#empty-body) (on by default) warns about likely accidental usage of semicolons after a loop or if condition that causes the body to be empty
* New warning: [-Wreversed-range](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html#reversed-range) (on by default) warns about a reversed open range that will behave as if it's an empty set instead
* Added [Python bindings](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/pyslang) for the library
* Driver code has been factored out of the slang-driver tool into a [Driver class](https://sv-lang.com/classslang_1_1driver_1_1_driver.html) that can be consumed by users of the library that are creating their own frontend tools
* slang now treats all input source files as being UTF-8 encoded. Previously slang required all sources to be ASCII encoded but did not strictly enforce that, and could behave incorrectly when encountering non-ASCII characters. Now all characters are validated and UTF-8 sequences are handled correctly (and are allowed without issue inside string literals and code comments). Invalid UTF-8 sequences are diagnosed and a warning will be issued.
* The default set of warnings was tweaked - some were added and some removed. See the [Warning Reference](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html) for more information about which are on by default.
* The `--libraries-inherit-macros` flag was added to allow macros defined in primary source files to bleed over into automatically loaded library files. The `--single-unit` option must also be used when providing this option.
* New options `--cmd-ignore` and `--cmd-rename` can be used when you have existing command files with option flags designed for another tool to process (thanks to @udif)
* New option `--ignore-directive` can be used to ignore vendor-specific preprocessor directives that would otherwise cause slang to flag an error (thanks to @udif)
* Added `--time-trace` to profile where slang is spending its compilation time

### Improvements
* slang now reports a better error when you forget to put parenthesis after a module or interface instantiation
* Lots of internal code cleanup, static analysis and lint fixes, and cleanup of TODOs in this release
* Large integers printed in diagnostics will now be abbreviated to avoid filling the console with tons of digits
* Added a limit to the size of instance arrays, to avoid hangs and running out of memory when typos produce huge array sizes. Use `--max-instance-array` if you run into the limit in a real design.
* Made several improvements to parser error recovery to cover common coding errors
* Several improvements were made to the SyntaxVisitor and SyntaxRewriter helper classes (thanks to @HungMingWu)
* Many improvements were made to the cmake build and installation flow. slang should be much more easily consumed as a library in downstream projects.
* Wrote more documentation and improved the doc build and its presentation
* A lot of code was reorganized internally into more easily discovered locations. Library code is now organized into namespaces.
* slang should now build correctly as a shared library out of the box
* Made several minor optimizations across the library that should add up to about 10-15% compilation speed improvement for typical workflows
* The minimum compiler version for slang was bumped to GCC 9. This will move to GCC 10 (and allow use of C++20 features) after the next release.

### Fixes
* Fixed ICE when a subroutine declaration refers to itself in its own return type declaration

* Fixed a parser bug where a colon followed immediately by a line comment would be parsed incorrectly (thanks to @HungMingWu)
* Fixed a parsing bug with `restrict property` statements
* Fixed several crashes and internal assertions in corner cases discovered by fuzz testing
* Fixed a number of cases where a proper diagnostic in an error scenario would be followed by one or more spurious diagnostics -- now only the one proper diagnostic is issued
* Fixed a number of cases where a diagnostic with a formatted message might put an empty string into that message, which was confusing and not helpful
* Constraint blocks are now correctly disallowed outside of class declarations
* The `$bits` system function can now correctly reference automatic variables from static initializers

* Fixed handling of defparams when there are infinitely recursive modules in the design
* The macro list printed by `--macros-only` is now sorted for consistent ordering between runs
* Fixed a bug where diagnostic pragmas were not correctly handled when found in automatically loaded library source files
* Source files listed in command files are now processed strictly in order relative to files listed in other command files, which gives predictable behavior when treating them as a single unit

* Fixed a bug that could cause case statements in constant expression to be misevaluated under certain conditions
* Fixed the inferred type of untyped parameters when initialized from an equivalent but not matching type expression
* Fixed a bug in the parser that could misparse delayed statements after an event control expression


## [v1.0] - 2022-06-25
### Highlights
slang can now detect and enforce all of the various rules surrounding multiple drivers on nets, variables, and ports. This release also comes with support for functional coverage constructs, opt-in support for hierarchical names used within constant expressions, and some additional compatibility functionality to make it easier to use with codebases that primarily build with other, less-conformant tools.

As of this release, no pre-built binaries will be included. They were of limited usefulness and difficult to maintain and so it's not worth providing them -- build from the source release instead.

### Language Support
* Added full support for covergroups, cover points, cover crosses, coverage bins and options.
* Added support for untyped mailboxes.
* Hierarchical references can now be used in constant expressions by passing the `--allow-hierarchical-const` flag. This is not strictly legal in SystemVerilog but other tools allow it and so slang supports it for compatibility.
* Added support for non-ansi interface ports.
* Added support for user-defined nettypes in module and interface port lists.
* Added support for non-ansi "multiports" and sliced ports.
* Added support for explicit ansi and non-ansi ports.
* Added support for generic interface ports.
* Added support for nested module and interface declarations.
* Added the LRM rules for port collapsing of dissimilar net types.
* Added rules around multiple drivers or mixed continuous and procedural drivers for variables and uwires.
* Added rules for port connection directions (input vs output).
* Added rules to disallow reading output clock variables or continuous assignments to the target of a clock variable.
* Added rules to disallow assertion local variables from being driven by more than one output local variable formal argument.
* Added rules about what timing controls are allowed in always_comb / always_latch / always_ff.
* Added rules for user-defined nettype resolution functions.
* Added LRM-specified warnings when net port coercion occurs.
* Added full support for interconnect nets.
* Added support for let declarations and nettypes inside of statement blocks.

### General Features
* A missing include directory passed to the driver tool is now a warning instead of an error.
* A `--compat` flag was added to allow specifying general compatibility requirements with other tools. Currently only `vcs` is supported as a value. This enables a bunch of other flags to try to be compatible with VCS as much as possible.
* `+incdir` and `+define` flags were added to increase compatibility with other tools.
* Support for "command files" was added -- use the `-F` and `-f` flags to specify the path to a command file. Command files allow more conveniently specifying large lists of files and command line options to an invocation of the tool. See [Command Files](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#command-files) for more detail.
* Added a $static_assert elaboration task that takes a condition and fails compilation if that condition is false. See [Nonstandard Built-In Functions](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#system-funcs) for an example.
* Added a `--relax-enum-conversions` flag to do less strict type checking of enum conversions, for compatibility with other tools.
* Integer literal overflow is now a warning instead of an error.
* All warning flags are now documented with examples here: [Warning Reference](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html)
* The `-Wno-top` warning flag was renamed to `-Wmissing-top` to avoid confusion with the -no prefix.
* Added a `--allow-dup-initial-drivers` flag which allows duplicate drivers from initial blocks instead of causing an error, for compatibility with other tools.
* By default, procedural `for` loops will be unrolled if possible before checking for duplicate driver errors. The LRM is actually more strict and does not allow this looser form of driver checking, so a `--strict-driver-checking` flag has been added to disable it. More details at [Driver Loop Unrolling](https://sv-lang.com/user-manual.html#loop-unroll).

### Fixes
* A better error is reported when trying to hierarchically refer to a type name.
* `$unit` based names are no longer erroneously considered hierarchical.
* The coverage system functions now allow a standalone `$root` as an argument.
* Finished a bunch of TODOs and corner case handling in port declarations.
* Made several tweaks to the parser's error recovery to get better diagnostics for commonly made mistakes.
* Fixed issues with non-ansi port declarations that used named types.
* Port initializers are now correctly required to be constants.
* The $dumpvars function is now allowed to dump nets as well.
* Fixed ICE when exporting an imported enum member from a package.
* Fixed the printing of hierarchical path names in diagnostics.
* Fixed macro stringification of substituted string literals.
* Parameters with unpacked dimensions are now allowed to have a partially inferred type (with a `logic` base element type).

* Fixed the threshold for unrecoverable lexer errors to not include warnings in the count.
* Fixed some corner cases where lvalues of system methods were not properly validated.
* Correctly error if there are duplicate out-of-block class method definitions.
* Correctly require for loop variable declarations to have initializers.
* Fixed a few parsing corner cases for user-defined primitives.
* Correctly disallow assertion local variables from being referenced in event expressions.
* Fixed an incorrect implicit conversion of string literals inside of concatenation expressions.


## [v0.9] - 2022-01-06

        array[i][j] = (i + 1) * (j + 1);
    end
end
```

* The minimum required cmake version has been bumped to 3.15
* Added a warning for non-blocking assignments used in final blocks (thanks @jrudess)
* Made some general improvements to the SyntaxRewriter APIs
* Instance caching was removed and parameter evaluation was reworked to better support hierarchical names in parameter values in the future. This is not allowed in SystemVerilog but some tools allow it anyway, so this sets the groundwork for eventually supporting it in slang as well.

## [v0.3] - 2020-03-24
### Highlights
As of this release the preprocessor is 100% complete. This does not mean bug free (though I hope so!) but rather that all known features are finished, all known bugs are fixed, and there is 100% coverage in unit tests.

* Added a general system for correcting typos. For example:
```SystemVerilog
module m;

```
```
source:3:15: error: use of undeclared identifier 'someIn'; did you mean 'someInt'?
    int foo = someIn;
              ^~~~~~
source:2:9: note: declared here
    int someInt;
        ^
```

### Fixes
* Lots of fixes to error recovery and error reporting in various cases
* Struct members that required looking up type names was previously broken and has now been fixed
* Fixed the check applied to enum initializers with unknown bits for 2-state base types
* Port connections were previously not being type checked; that has been fixed
* Fixed the result type of unary bitwise-not expressions


## [v0.2] - 2020-01-20
This release fills in a bunch of missing holes and corner cases and cleans up a bunch of bugs. The first beginnings of a more structured release process and documentation system are in place.

This is the first release as of which feature support is tracked in the documentation.


## [v0.1] - 2019-12-02
This is the first release of slang that is somewhat useful. The library supports lexing, preprocessing, parsing, type checking, and elaboration for a good portion of the language. The slang tool can be run on medium to large codebases and print out useful diagnostics.

There's still plenty of work to do but it seemed like a good idea to take a checkpoint.
