-Wunknown-escape-code
Detects use of unknown character escape codes in string literals.
```
string s = "Hello World\q";
```

-Wnonstandard-escape-code
Detects use of '\\\%' in string literals. This is not a real escape code
but other tools silently allow it anyway.
```
string s = "Hello World\%";
```

-Wreal-underflow
Issued for real literals that are too small to be represented.
```
real r = 4.94066e-325;
```

-Wreal-overflow
Issued for real literals that are too large to be represented.

real r = 1.79769e+309;
```

-Wvector-overflow
Issued for vector literals that are larger than their specified number of bits.
```
logic [7:0] i = 7'd256;
```

-Wint-overflow
Issued for integer literals that overflow a 32-bit integer (31-bits plus sign).
```
int i = 2147483648;
```

-Wignored-macro-paste
Points out macro concatenation tokens that aren't actually concatenating anything due
to whitespace on either side, or tokens that can't be concatenated in the first place.
```
`define FOO(a) a `` +
int foo;
int bar = `FOO(foo) foo;
```

-Wredef-macro
Issued for redefining a macro name with a different body.
```
`define FOO 1
`define FOO 2
```

-Wunknown-pragma
Issued for an unknown pragma directive.
```
`pragma foo
```

-Wextra-pragma-args
Issued for a pragma directive that specifies more arguments than expected.
```
`pragma resetall extraarg
```

-Wexpected-diag-arg
Issued for a pragma diagnostic directive that is missing an argument.
```
`pragma diagnostic
```

-Wunknown-diag-arg
Issued for an unknown argument given to a pragma diagnostic directive.
```
`pragma diagnostic pushh
```

-Wpragma-diag-level
Issued for a malformed diagnostic pragma. A severity code was expected
where the given location is indicated.
```
`pragma diagnostic foo=3'd3
```

-Wnonstandard-generate
Indicates a standalone generate block (begin / end pair) without a corresponding
generate loop or condition. This was allowed in older Verilog standards but
is no longer allowed in SystemVerilog.
```
module m;
    begin : gen_block
        int i = 1;
    end
endmodule
```

-Wempty-pattern
Issued for empty assignment pattern literals, which are not allowed by
SystemVerilog but are supported by some tools.
```
int foo[] = '{};
```

-Wnonstandard-foreach
foreach loops are not allowed to have multidimensional brackets when declaring
loop variables, but most tools allow it as an extension.
```
module top;
    int array[8][8];
    initial begin
        foreach (array[i]) begin
            foreach (array[i][j]) begin
                array[i][j] = i * j;
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

-Wlifetime-prototype
Lifetime specifiers are not allowed on method prototype declarations but some
tools allow it as an extension.
```
class C;
    extern function automatic void foo;
endclass

function automatic void C::foo;
endfunction
```

-Wnonstandard-dist
'dist' constraint items are technically not allowed to be surrounded by parentheses according
to the language grammar, but most tools allow it as an extension.
```
class C;
    rand bit a;
    rand bit [3:0] b;
    constraint cmd_c {
        a -> (b dist { 0 := 1, [1:15] := 1});
    }
endclass
```

-Wempty-body
An empty statement body for a loop or conditional statement could be confusing or misleading.
If intended, move the semicolon to a separate line to suppress the warning.
```
module m;
    initial begin
        if (1); begin
        end
    end
endmodule
```

-Wsplit-distweight-op
Some tools allow the dist weight operators to be split instead of a single token.
slang will issue this warning as an error by default but it can be downgraded for compatibility.
```
class c;
  rand int val;
  constraint cst_sum {
    val dist {1 :    = 10, 4 :   / 20};
  }
endclass
```

-Wwarning-task
A $warning elaboration task was encountered. Its message is printed by this diagnostic.
```
$warning("Hello World!");
```

-Wexplicit-static
static variables declared locally to a procedural block that contain an initializer require
that the 'static' keyword be explicitly provided (and not just inferred from context) to
clarify that the initialization happens only once. Most tools don't enforce this rule,
so this is just a warning instead of an error.
```
module m;
    initial begin
        int i = 1;
    end
endmodule
```

-Wcase-gen-dup
More than one case generate item was found to have the same value. The second
case block will never be selected.
```
module m;
    case (1)
        1: begin end
        1: begin end
    endcase
endmodule
```

-Wcase-gen-none
A case generate directive did not match any items and so no block was selected.
```
module m;
    case (1)
        0: begin end
    endcase
endmodule
```

-Wunconnected-port
An instance port was left unconnected and it has no default value.
```
module m(input int i);
endmodule

module n;
    m m1();
endmodule
```

-Wunconnected-unnamed-port
An unnamed instance port was left unconnected.
```
module m({a, b});
    input a, b;
endmodule

module n;
    m m1();
endmodule
```

-Wimplicit-net-port
A net port that elides its net type occurs in a context where `default_nettype is set to 'none'.
This technically should be an error but it makes the use of 'none' as a default nettype very
annoying and most tools just default to a wire in this case.
```
`default_nettype none

module m(input i);
endmodule
```

-Wdup-attr
A design element has more than one attribute of the same name.
Only the last one will apply.
```
module m;
    (* foo = 1, foo = 2 *)
    int i;
endmodule
```

-Wempty-member
An unnecessary semicolon is located in a non-procedural scope (such as a module body).
```
module m;
    ;
endmodule
```

-Wineffective-sign
For a non-ANSI instance port or function body port declaration, the port I/O specifies a
signing keyword but the actual data type of the port does not permit that signing to take effect.
```
module m(a);
    input unsigned a;
    int a;
endmodule
```

-Wconstraint-missing
An implicit class constraint block has no external definition and so is useless.
```
class C;
    constraint c;
endclass
```

-Wdpi-spec
Old-style "DPI" specified subroutines are deprecated and not supported by slang.
Use the new-style "DPI-C" which has a well-defined standardized calling convention.
```
import "DPI" function void foo();
```

-Wudp-port-empty
A connection to a user-defined primitive instance is an empty expression.
While allowed, this is easily confused with a misplaced comma and is likely
not what you want.
```
primitive p1 (output a, input b);
    table 00:0; endtable
endprimitive

module m;
    logic a;
    p1 (a,);
endmodule
```

-Wnet-inconsistent
A connection (or part of a connection) between an external net and an internal net
port has inconsistent net types. The SystemVerilog LRM defines which combinations
of net types are inconsistent and should produce a warning; see section [23.3.3.7]
"Port connections with dissimilar net types (net and port collapsing)" for more detail.
```
module m (input .a({b, {c[1:0], d}}));
    wand b;
    wand [3:0] c;
    supply0 d;
endmodule

module top;
    wand a;
    wor b;
    trireg [1:0] c;
    m m1({a, b, c});
endmodule
```

-Wignored-slice
A streaming operator with direction left-to-right provides a slice size, which
has no effect because only right-to-left streaming can use a slice size.
```
int a;
int b = {>> 4 {a}};
```

-Wunsized-concat
An unsized type is used in a concatenation. This is not allowed in SystemVerilog
but most tools allow it anyway as an extension.
```
longint i = {1, 2};
```

-Wwidth-expand
An implicit conversion in an expression expands a type. This may be harmless,
but the warning provides a mechanism for discovering unintended conversions.
An explicit cast can be used to silence the warning.
```
logic [1:0] a;
int b = a;
```

-Wwidth-trunc
An implicit conversion in an expression truncates a type. This conversion
potentially loses data. An explicit cast can be used to silence the warning.
```
int a;
logic [1:0] b = a;
```

-Wport-width-expand
An implicit conversion in a port connection expression expands a type. This may
be harmless, but the warning provides a mechanism for discovering unintended conversions.
An explicit cast can be used to silence the warning.
```
module m(input int a); endmodule

module n;
    logic [1:0] a;
    m m1(.a(a));
endmodule
```

-Wport-width-trunc
An implicit conversion in a port connection expression truncates a type.
This conversion potentially loses data. An explicit cast can be used to silence the warning.
```
module m(input logic [1:0] a); endmodule

module n;
    int a;
    m m1(.a(a));
endmodule
```

-Wimplicit-conv
An implicit conversion in an expression converts between two unrelated types.
SystemVerilog allows this for all packed integral types but it often
indicates a mistake in the code.
```
module m;
    struct packed { logic a; int b; } foo;
    union packed { int a; int b; } bar;
    initial foo = bar;
endmodule
```

-Wnonblocking-final
A nonblocking assignment is used in a 'final' block, which will have no effect.
```
module m;
    int i;
    final begin
        i <= 1;
    end
endmodule
```

-Wport-coercion
An input net port has been coerced to 'inout' direction because it is assigned
to in the instance body. Alternatively, an output net port has been coerced to
'inout' direction because it is assigned externally to the instance.
```
module m(input wire a, output b);
    assign a = 1;
endmodule

module n;
    wire b;
    m m1(1, b);
    assign b = 1;
endmodule
```

-Wevent-const
An event expression is a constant and so will never change.
```
module m;
    always @(1) begin
    end
endmodule
```

-Wempty-stmt
An extra semicolon in a procedural context implies an empty statement that does nothing.
```
module m;
    initial begin
        ;
    end
endmodule
```

-Wpointless-void-cast
A function call is cast to 'void' but it already returns void so the cast is pointless.
```
module m;
    function void foo; endfunction
    initial begin
        void'(foo());
    end
endmodule
```

-Wunused-result
A non-void function is invoked without inspecting its return value. Capture the result
or cast the call to 'void' to suppress the warning.
```
module m;
    function int foo; return 1; endfunction
    initial begin
        foo();
    end
endmodule
```

-Wenum-range
An enum member is specified as a range with values that are not integer literals.
The LRM does not allow other constant expressions to be used here.
```
localparam int i = 1;
typedef enum { A[i:3] } e_t;
```

-Wdup-import
A given scope contains more than one import statement for the same package and name.
```
package p;
    int i;
endpackage

module m;
    import p::i;
    import p::i;
endmodule
```

-Wformat-real
A string formatting function was passed a real value for an integer format specifier,
which will force the value to round to an integer.
```
module m;
    initial $display("%d", 3.14);
endmodule
```

-Wfinish-num
The $finish control task accepts a "finish number" of 0, 1, or 2 as its first argument.
The actual call to $finish in this case passed something other than one of those values.
```
module m;
    initial $finish("Hello");
endmodule
```

-Wmissing-format
A string formatting function has a lone '%%' at the end of the format string,
implying that the rest of the specifier is missing. If a literal '%%' is intended
in the output, use the standard '%%%' to achieve that.
```
module m;
    initial $display("Hello World %");
endmodule
```

-Wformat-multibit-strength
Formatting multibit nets with the %%v specifier is not allowed in SystemVerilog
but most tools allow it anyway as an extension.
```
module m;
    wire [3:0] w;
    initial $display("%v", w);
endmodule
```

-Wnonstandard-sys-func
Indicates a call to a nonstandard system function. Currently this only applies
to the $psprintf function, which is a synonym for $sformatf.
```
module m;
    initial $psprintf("%d", 42);
endmodule
```

-Welem-not-found
A constant function tried to access a nonexistent element of an associative array.
```
localparam int foo = func();
function int func;
    int i[string];
    return i["Hello"];
endfunction
```

-Wstatic-skipped
A constant function contains a static variable with an initializer. That initializer
will be skipped during constant evaluation, which could lead to unintuitive results.
```
localparam int foo = func();
function int func;
    static int i = 1;
    return i;
endfunction
```

-Wdynarray-index
A constant function tried to access a nonexistent element of a dynamic array.
```
localparam int foo = func();
function int func;
    automatic int i[] = new [2];
    return i[4];
endfunction
```

-Wdynarray-range
A constant function tried to access a nonexistent range of a dynamic array.
```
typedef int ret_type[2];
localparam ret_type foo = func();
function ret_type func;
    automatic int i[] = new [2];
    return i[6:7];
endfunction
```

-Wqueue-range
A constant function is accessing a queue with a reversed range, which
is defined to always yield an empty queue.
```
typedef int ret_type[$];
localparam ret_type foo = func();
function ret_type func;
    automatic int i[$] = {1, 2, 3};
    return i[2:0];
endfunction
```

-Wempty-queue
A constant function tried to pop an element from an empty queue.
```
localparam int foo = func();
function int func;
    automatic int i[$];
    return i.pop_back();
endfunction
```

-Wtask-ignored
A constant function contains a system task invocation which will
be skipped during constant evaluation. This could yield unintuitive results.
```
localparam string foo = func();
function string func;
    automatic string s;
    $swrite(s, "asdf %d", 3);
    return s;
endfunction
```

-Wmissing-top
No valid top-level modules exist in the design. No top has been instantiated.
```
module m #(parameter int i);
endmodule
```

-Wunknown-warning-option
<ignored>

-Wreversed-range
An open range with constant bounds is reversed (i.e. has a larger left-hand side compared to its right).
Such a range will behave as if it's empty and therefore never be selected.
```
class C;
    rand bit [4:0] a;
    constraint a_c {
        a dist { 16 :/ 1, [15:1] :/ 1};
    }
endclass
```

-Winvalid-source-encoding
<ignored>

-Wexpected-protect-keyword
A `pragma protect directive is missing the protect keyword to set.
```
`pragma protect
```

-Wunknown-protect-keyword
A `pragma protect directive specified an unknown keyword.
```
`pragma protect foobar
```

-Wexpected-protect-arg
An invalid argument is passed to a `pragma protect keyword expecting a string value.
```
`pragma protect author=3
```

-Wnested-protect-begin
Nested `pragma protect begin directives were found, which is disallowed.
```
`pragma protect begin
`pragma protect begin
```

-Wextra-protect-end
An unpair `pragma protect end or end_protected was found in the source text.
```
`pragma protect end
```

-Wprotect-arglist
A `pragma protect keyword expected a list of key=value options but did not receive them.
```
`pragma protect encoding=3
```

-Wunknown-protect-encoding
The specified encoding name in a `pragma protect encoding directive is not known or supported.
slang will try to work with the encoded data as though it were raw, which may or may not parse
correctly depending on how the actual encoding functions.
```
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="foobar")
```

-Wunknown-protect-option
An unknown key=value option was passed to a `pragma protect keyword.
```
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="base64", foo="bar")
```

-Winvalid-pragma-number
A `pragma protect option expected a valid 32-bit integer value but received something else instead.
```
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="base64", line_length="hello")
```

-Winvalid-pragma-viewport
A `pragma protect viewport directive was given invalid options. All such directives must be of
the form (object = &lt;string>, access = &lt;string>)
```
`pragma protect viewport=(not_object = "hello")
```

-Windex-oob
An out-of-bounds value was used to index an array. This is an error by default but can be downgraded to
a warning for compatibility with other tools.
```
logic [7:0] a;
logic b = a[9];
```

-Wrange-oob
An out-of-bounds range was used to select from an array. This is an error by default but can be downgraded to
a warning for compatibility with other tools.
```
logic [7:0] a;
logic [2:0] b = a[9:7];
```

-Wrange-width-oob
An indexed part-select has a width that is wider than the bounds of the array it is selecting. This is an error
by default but can be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools.
```
logic [1:0] a;
int b;
logic [2:0] c = a[b+:3];
```

-Wduplicate-definition
A module has been defined using the same name as a previously defined module. This is an error
by default but can be downgraded to a warning for compatibility with other tools.
This applies to both top level modules as well as nested modules (but only duplicated nested modules within the same scope,
as it is OK to have modules with the same name in different scopes).
```
module a;
endmodule;

module a;
endmodule
```

-Wprotect-encoding-bytes
An encoded block in a protected envelope differed in size from what was specified in
a prior encoding pragma directive.
```
`pragma protect begin_protected
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="base64", bytes=6), data_public_key
asdfas==
`pragma protect end_protected
```

-Winvalid-encoding-byte
A character in an encoded protected envelope is invalid for the kind of encoding specified.
The rest of the protected envelope will be skipped by searching for an end pragma.
```
`pragma protect begin_protected
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="base64"), data_block
asdf()0123
`pragma protect end_protected
```

-Wraw-protect-eof
A "raw" encoded protected envelope did not terminate before the end of the source file.
```
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="raw"), data_block
asdfasdf
```

-Wprotected-envelope
Any use of a pragma protect region in the source will trigger this warning, as slang is
unable to actually decrypt the contents of that region (it is assumed that no IP vendor
would be willing to share decryption keys with an open source tool anyway). The text will
be decoded and skipped in its entirety, which may or may not result in a valid design.
```
`pragma protect begin_protected
`pragma protect encoding=(enctype="raw"), data_block
asdfasdf
`pragma protect end_protected
```

-Wspecify-param
The LRM disallows using parameters inside of specify blocks. Most tools allow this with
a warning so slang makes it a warning as well.
```
module m(input [1:0] a, output [1:0] b);
    parameter p = 1;
    specify
        (a[p] => b[0]) = 1;
    endspecify
endmodule
```

-Wdup-timing-path
More than one specify timing path was given for a particular pair of input and output
terminals in a module.
```
module m(input a, output b);
    specify
        (a => b) = 1;
        (a => b) = 2;
    endspecify
endmodule
```

-Winvalid-pulsestyle
A `pulsestyle` or `showcancelled` declaration targets an output terminal that has
previously been used in a timing path declaration, which is not allowed according to the LRM.
```
module m(input a, output b);
    specify
        (a => b) = 1;
        pulsestyle_ondetect b;
    endspecify
endmodule
```

-Wnegative-timing-limit
A system timing check parameter that should be positive has a negative value.
```
module m(input a, b);
    specify
        $setup(posedge a, b, -1);
    endspecify
endmodule
```

-Wunused-def
A module, interface, or program definition is unused in the design.
\n\n
A definition with name '_' will never warn. Attributes `(* unused *)` or `(* maybe_unused *)`
may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular definition.
```
module m #(parameter int i);
endmodule

module top;
endmodule
```

-Wunused-net
A net is declared but never used.
\n\n
A net with name '_' will never warn. Attributes `(* unused *)` or `(* maybe_unused *)`
may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular net.
```
module m;
    wire w;
endmodule
```

-Wunused-implicit-net
An implicitly created net is not referenced elsewhere in the design.
This is often a typo in the name and not intentional.
\n\n
A net with name '_' will never warn.
```
module m(output x);
    assign x = 1;
endmodule

module n;
    logic typo;
    m m1(typa);
endmodule
```

-Wunused-variable

may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular variable.
```
module m;
    int i;
endmodule
```

-Wundriven-net
A net is used but never has a value driven.
\n\n
A net with name '_' will never warn. Attributes `(* unused *)` or `(* maybe_unused *)`

    int i;
    initial i = 42;
endmodule
```

-Wunused-port
An input port signal is never used internally to the module.
\n\n

may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular port.
```
module m(input x);
endmodule
```

-Wundriven-port
An output port signal is never given a value.
\n\n
A port with name '_' will never warn. Attributes `(* unused *)` or `(* maybe_unused *)`
may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular port.
```
module m(output x);
endmodule
```

-Wunused-but-set-port
A port has a value assigned but that value is never used. This only applies to 'inout' ports.
The assumption is that if the port doesn't need to be read, the direction should be changed
to 'output' instead.
\n\n
A port with name '_' will never warn. Attributes `(* unused *)` or `(* maybe_unused *)`
may be applied to suppress this warning for a particular port.
```
module m(inout x);
    assign x = 1;
endmodule
```

-Wbad-procedural-force
According to the Verilog/SystemVerilog standard, it is illegal to procedurally force a
bit-select or range select of a variable (you can do that with a net, or with a plain
variable). It is an error by default, but can be turned into a warning, to support code
compatibility with commercial tools that accept this illegal code.
```
module m;
    reg [1:0]r;
    initial
        force r[0] = 1'b0;
endmodule
```

-Wduplicate-defparam
More than one defparam targets the same parameter. The LRM specifies that this is undefined
behavior. slang takes the value from the first defparam it sees and ignores the rest.
```
module m;
    parameter p = 1;
endmodule

module n;
    defparam m1.p = 3;
endmodule

module top;
    m m1();
    n n1();
    defparam m1.p = 2;
endmodule
```

-Wimplicit-port-type-mismatch
An implicit named port connection is made between two inequivalent types. Unlike with a normal
port connection, where the type of the connection undergoes implicit conversion, the LRM specifies
that this case is an error. slang makes this an error by default but it can be turned into a warning,
to support code compatibility with commercial tools.
```
module m(logic p);
endmodule

module n;
    int p;
    m m1(.p);
endmodule
```
