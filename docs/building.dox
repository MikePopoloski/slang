/** @page building Building & Installation
@brief Instructions for building and installing the slang library and tools

@tableofcontents

@section source Getting the Source

All source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang)

@code{.ansi}
git clone https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang.git
@endcode

@section build-requirements Build Requirements

slang requires the following tools in order to build:
- [python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (3.20 or later)
- C++20 compatible compiler. Minimum supported compiler versions:
    - GCC 11
    - clang 17
    - Xcode 16
    - MSVC support is tested only against the most recent update of VS 2022

@section building-start Quick Start

The build should work out of the box on all supported platforms with the same set of steps:

@code{.ansi}
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j
@endcode

Tests are included in the configuration by default. You can run them via ctest:

@code{.ansi}
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
@endcode

@section dependencies Dependencies

slang depends on several 3rd party libraries. By default, if not found installed on your local
machine the build will fetch and include them from GitHub via CMake's FetchContent feature,
to preserve the ability to always build fresh out of the box.

@section build-options Build Options

Besides the built-in CMake options, there are slang-specific options that may be
set to customize the build:
Option | Description | Default
------ | ----------- | -------
SLANG_INCLUDE_TOOLS | Include tools targets in the build (such as the slang driver executable) | ON
SLANG_INCLUDE_TESTS | Include tests in the build | ON
SLANG_INCLUDE_INSTALL | Include installation targets in the build | ON
SLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS | Include docs in the build | OFF
SLANG_INCLUDE_PYLIB | Include Python bindings in the build | OFF
SLANG_INCLUDE_COVERAGE | Include code coverage targets in the build | OFF
SLANG_INCLUDE_THREADTEST | Include threadtest target in the build | OFF
SLANG_INCLUDE_UVM_TEST | Include UVM as a test target in the build | OFF
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS | Build a shared library instead of static | OFF
SLANG_USE_MIMALLOC | Enable use of the mimalloc library. Can be turned off, the resulting library will be slightly slower. | ON
SLANG_USE_CPPTRACE | Enable use of the cpptrace library | OFF
SLANG_FUZZ_TARGET | Turn on to enable some changes to make binaries easier to fuzz test | OFF
SLANG_CI_BUILD | Enable additional longer-running tests for automated builds | OFF
SLANG_CLANG_TIDY | The path to a clang-tidy binary to run against the slang sources | ""
SLANG_WARN_FLAGS | Extra compiler warning flags to enable when building slang | ""
SLANG_CMAKECONFIG_INSTALL_DIR | If install rules are included, this path is used to install the generated CMake config for the slang package | ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/slang

@section build-scripts Build Scripts

This section documents scripts that are invoked during the build that may be of
general interest or useful to know if you're modifying how the build works.

## Version info

On every build, the current git revision hash is queried and included in the `Version.cpp`
header to expose to the rest of the library. If the revision is unchanged from the last
build no additional work will be done.

## Syntax generation

Syntax nodes in slang are expressed in the `scripts/syntax.txt` file and processed
during the build into generated C++ classes by the `syntax_gen.py` script.

## Diagnostic generation

Diagnostics, similarly to syntax nodes, are expressed in the `scripts/diagnostics.txt`
file and processed into C++ definitions by the `diagnostic_gen.py` script.

@section doc-builds Building Documentation

This section contains instructions for building the documentation.

## Dependencies

- [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) - at least 1.9

## Steps

Run CMake with docs enabled:

@code{.ansi}
cmake -B build -DSLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=ON
cmake --build build --target docs
@endcode

The output website is located at `build/docs/html/`

@section python-binding-builds Building Python Bindings

This section contains instructions for building and installing the Python bindings, which are created with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Steps

1. Clone the `slang` repository (https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang), if you haven't already.

2. Optionally, create a virtual environment and activate it.

@code{.ansi}
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
@endcode

3. Install `pyslang` as a Python package (including building the C++ `slang` library with bindings):

@code{.ansi}
# Option 1: Install Pyslang (takes 5-10 minutes to build), using a fully-isolated build each time:
pip install .

# Option 2: Install Pyslang, caching build products across rebuilds:
pip install pybind11 scikit-build-core
pip install . --no-build-isolation --config-settings build-dir=build/python_build
@endcode

## Steps: Run the Python tests

The Python tests are built and executed using the `pytest` framework.

Install test/development dependencies, and run the Python tests:

@code{.ansi}
pip install '.[test]'
pytest
@endcode

@section installation Installation

CMake can be used to install slang.

@code{.ansi}
cmake --install build --strip
@endcode

You can use the `--prefix` option to control where the installation gets placed in case you
want something other than the default on your system.

@section integration Integration

Integrating the slang library into your own build is straightforward if you use CMake.
Link your target to the `slang::slang` CMake target and everything else should be
set up for you automatically.

Some possible options for locating the slang package are as follows:

## External Package

If you followed the installation steps above and installed the slang package on your system
in one of the default locations, you should be able to use a simple `find_package` to pull
it into your build.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(example)

find_package(slang 1.0.0)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE slang::slang)
```

See [this GitHub project](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang_package_example) as an example of integrating slang using this method.

## FetchContent

Instead of installing the slang package on your system, you can instead instruct CMake to pull the source
from GitHub and build it as part of your own project.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(example)

# Note: this example just pulls the head master branch
# for slang, but a real project would very likely pin
# this to a specific tag and only update when ready
# to accept a new version.
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  slang
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang.git
  GIT_SHALLOW ON)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(slang)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE slang::slang)
```

See [this GitHub project](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang_subproject_example) as an example of integrating slang using this method.
