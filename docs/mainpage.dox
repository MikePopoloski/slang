/** @mainpage slang

slang is a software library that provides various components for lexing,
parsing, type checking, and elaborating SystemVerilog code. It comes with
an executable tool that can compile and lint any SystemVerilog project,
but it is also intended to be usable as a front end for synthesis tools,
simulators, linters, code editors, and refactoring tools.

slang is the fastest and most compliant SystemVerilog frontend (according to the open source [chipsalliance test suite](https://github.com/chipsalliance/sv-tests)).

@section mainpage-features Features

-   Fully parse, analyze, and elaborate all SystemVerilog features -
    see @ref language-support for current status.
-   Be robust about compilation, no matter how broken the source text. This makes the compiler
    usable in editor highlighting and completion scenarios, where the code is likely to be broken
    because the user is still writing it.
-   The parse tree should round trip back to the original source, making it easy to write refactoring
    and code generation tools.
-   Provide great error messages, ala clang.
-   Be fast and robust in the face of production-scale projects.

@section use-cases Use Cases

Some examples of things you can use slang for:
-   Very fast syntax checking and linting tool
-   Dumping the AST of your project to JSON
-   Source code introspection via included Python bindings
-   SystemVerilog code generation and refactoring
-   As the engine for an editor language server
-   As a fast and robust preprocessor that sits in front of downstream tools
-   As a frontend for a synthesis or simulation tool, by including slang as a library

@section mainpage-getting-started Getting Started

Instructions on building slang from source are here: @ref building

The slang binary can be run on your code right out of the box; check out the
@ref user-manual for more information about how it works.

If you're looking to use slang as a library, please read through the @ref developer-guide.
